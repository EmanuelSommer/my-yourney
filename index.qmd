I'm Emanuel, a Mathematician & Data Scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics. Here, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my *hikes on the paths of curiosity*. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. This can be attributed to two key reasons.

1. Hiking is a **naturally curious** activity as I thrive to explore unseen territories, to challenge myself as well as to get better and grow with every step along the way. 

2. Much like my pursuits, hiking demands **endurance, good planning, and adaptability** in the face of changing circumstances, just like sudden weather changes.

As you delve into this website, you'll mostly find my personal paths whose topics are related to **Math**, **Stats**, **Tech**, and my **Professional Journey**. Here's a preview of what you can explore on this website:

- **About:** Want to know some more about me? This section is a good starting point and also covers my education, professional work experiences and tech stack. 

- **Publications:** As the name suggests this section covers papers, software and other noteworthy publications.

- **Thoughts & Endeavors:** A kind of mini blog â€“ think hobby projects, hackathons, resources and possibly even a sprinkle of non data science related stories. :)
