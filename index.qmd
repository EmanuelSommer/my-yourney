I'm Emanuel, a Mathematician & Data Scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics. Here, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my *hike on the paths of curiosity*. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. Here's why I think it fits so perfectly: 

1. Hiking is a naturally curious activity as one thrives to explore unseen territories, to challenge oneself and to get better every time. 

2. Much like my pursuits, hiking demands endurance, good planning, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances, much like sudden weather changes.

As you delve into this website, you'll mostly find the subset of my personal paths closely related to **Math**, **Stats**, **Tech**, and my **professional journey**. Specifically the website contains the following sections:

- **About:** Where I come from and where I wanna go is sketched in this  section which also covers my education, professional work experiences and tech stack. 

- **Publications:** This section not surprisingly covers papers, software and other noteworthy publications.

- **Thoughts & Endeavors:** A kind of mini blog â€“ think hobby projects, hackathons, ressources and even a sprinkle of non data science related stories. :)
