    "text": "I’m Emanuel 👋\nA Mathematician & Data Scientist pursuing a PhD in Stats & ML.\nHere, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my hikes on the paths of curiosity. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. This can be attributed to two key reasons.\n\nHiking is a naturally curious activity as I thrive to explore unseen territories, to challenge myself as well as to get better and grow with every step along the way.\nMuch like my pursuits, hiking demands endurance, good planning, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances, just like sudden weather changes.\n\nAs you delve into this website, you’ll mostly find content related to Math, Stats, Tech, and my Professional Journey. Here’s a preview of what you can explore on this website:\n\nAbout - Want to know some more about me? This section is a good starting point and also covers my Education, professional Work Experiences and Tech Stack.\nPublications - As the name suggests this section covers Papers, Software and other noteworthy Publications.\nThoughts & Endeavors - A kind of mini blog – think Hobby Projects, Hackathons, Resources and possibly even a sprinkle of non Data Science related stories. :)"

An ensemble learner highly dependent on tree based models was used, followed by a custom greedy optimization. The Exploratory Data Analysis {tidyverse}, the modeling {caret} and the optimization was implemented in .\nDuring the finals in Munich with the best teams of the online competition worldwide the solution was presented in front of and evaluated by an expert jury. Finally we achieved one of the top ten final scores.\n\nNote: After now having participated in a couple of hackathons I have to give big Kudos to everyone that was involved in the organization of this amazing international celebration of engineering! It really was perfectly thought through and executed from the main problem to be solved to all the subtle details throughout the finals!"

    "text": "The idea for this small project was born when many of the students of the course Statistics of Business Administration, where I was a tutor, had problems understanding the concept of P-values. Thus I created an  package that visualizes the P-values in the common setting of hypothesis tests for the 4 most common distributions. The usage, as it is meant for beginners in the field of statistics, is very straight forward.\nMain  packages used: {ggplot2}, {devtools}\nWanna check it out? Click here"

The prediction model is a convolutional deep neural network (CNN) implemented via the Keras API of Tensorflow. The app allows to explore and amend the custom database that was created for the Machine Learning task. Moreover it contains visualisations of the model architecture and valuation metrics. Above all it enables the user to challange the model with handwritten boxes.\nMain  packages used: {tensorflow}, {keras}, {golem}, {shiny}, {shinymodules}, {fullPage}, {waiter}, {googlesheets4} and packages of the {tidyverse}\nWanna learn more?

    "text": "I am beyond thrilled to share that our paper, “Connecting the Dots: Is Mode-Connectedness the Key to Feasible Sample-Based Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks?”, has been accepted at ICML 2024! 🎉 This achievement is particularly special to me as it marks my first work during my relatively new PhD journey and my initial venture into the fascinating world of Bayesian Deep Learning.\nBeing accepted into ICML, one of the largest and most prestigious machine learning conferences, is a dream come true. I’m incredibly excited to be part of this vibrant community and look forward to presenting our work also at the colocated 6th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference.\nThe review process for ICML was quite different from the journal experience I’ve had before—much more intense and significantly shorter. Despite the challenges, this rigorous review helped sharpen our research and brought out the best in our work. I’m grateful to my co-authors for their invaluable contributions and to the reviewers for their insightful feedback.\nThis project has already sparked numerous exciting ideas and has led to engaging discussions with some incredibly smart and interesting people. I can’t wait to see where this journey leads next!\nIf you’ll be in Vienna for ICML, I’d love to connect!\nCheck out our paper on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01484"
