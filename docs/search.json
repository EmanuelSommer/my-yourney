    "text": "I’m Emanuel 👋\nA Mathematician & Data Scientist pursuing a PhD in Stats & ML.\nHere, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my hikes on the paths of curiosity. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. This can be attributed to two key reasons.\n\nHiking is a naturally curious activity as I thrive to explore unseen territories, to challenge myself as well as to get better and grow with every step along the way.\nMuch like my pursuits, hiking demands endurance, good planning, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances, just like sudden weather changes.\n\nAs you delve into this website, you’ll mostly find content related to Math, Stats, Tech, and my Professional Journey. Here’s a preview of what you can explore on this website:\n\nAbout - Want to know some more about me? This section is a good starting point and also covers my Education, professional Work Experiences and Tech Stack.\nPublications - As the name suggests this section covers Papers, Software and other noteworthy Publications.\nThoughts & Endeavors - A kind of mini blog – think Hobby Projects, Hackathons, Resources and possibly even a sprinkle of non Data Science related stories. :)"

    "text": "Reading the great book Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps was my inspiration to this project where I first did everything E2E from Data Collection over Modelling and finally serving the models in a user friendly manner again through the deployed app.\nThe app is written using the {golem} framework for production-grade and robust shiny apps. The prediction model is a convolutional deep neural network (CNN) implemented via the Keras API of Tensorflow. The app allows to explore and amend the custom database that was created for the Machine Learning task. Moreover it contains visualisations of the model architecture and valuation metrics. Above all it enables the user to challange the model with handwritten boxes.\nMain  packages used: {tensorflow}, {keras}, {golem}, {shiny}, {shinymodules}, {fullPage}, {waiter}, {googlesheets4} and packages of the {tidyverse}\nWanna learn more?

My topic and thus covered in this project are boosting methods. First I guide the reader through some theory about (tree-based) gradient boosting and the famous and very efficient implementation of such a model XGBoost. Then I illustrate the discussed model with two real world data sets in a regression setting.\nMain  packages used: {tidymodels}, {xgboost}, {bookdown}, {xaringan} and packages of the {tidyverse}\nWanna check it out?
