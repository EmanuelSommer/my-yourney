    "text": "I’m Emanuel, a Mathematician & Data Scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics. Here, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my hikes on the paths of curiosity. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. This can be attributed to two key reasons.\n\nHiking is a naturally curious activity as I thrive to explore unseen territories, to challenge myself as well as to get better and grow with every step along the way.\nMuch like my pursuits, hiking demands endurance, good planning, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances, just like sudden weather changes.\n\nAs you delve into this website, you’ll mostly find my personal paths whose topics are related to Math, Stats, Tech, and my Professional Journey. Here’s a preview of what you can explore on this website:\n\nAbout: Where I come from and where I wanna go is sketched in this section which also covers my education, professional work experiences and tech stack.\nPublications: As the name suggests this section covers papers, software and other noteworthy publications.\nThoughts & Endeavors: A kind of mini blog – think hobby projects, hackathons, resources and possibly even a sprinkle of non data science related stories. :)"
