These range from high-dimensional Financial Risk to large-scale Learning-to-Rank Models, serving thousands hourly.\nWith a B.Sc. & M.Sc. in Mathematics from TUM, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in Statistics, ML, and Probability Theory. Following industry experience as a ML Practitioner, I‚Äôm now pursuing a PhD in Statistics, fusing statistical rigor with the flexibilty and scalibility of modern ML.\n\n\n\nBeyond data, I‚Äôm an enthusiast for hiking, food, travel, often sharing these experiences with my amazing girlfriend. Thriving on challenges and fueled by collaboration, I‚Äôm all about the journey from the beauty of math to impactful innovation, while having fun along the way! üöÄüåç\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD Candiate @ the Data Science Group - Department of Statistics\nLudwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen (LMU) | Oct 2023 - Now\n\n\nM.Sc. in Mathematics in Data Science\nTechnische Universit√§t M√ºnchen (TUM) | April 2020 - Mai 2022\n\nThesis on Estimation and Backtesting of the Expected Shortfall and Value at Risk using Vine Copulas\nFocus on Machine Learning and Statistics\nPassed with Distinction\n\n\n\nB.Sc. in Mathematics\nTechnische Universit√§t M√ºnchen (TUM) | Oct 2016 - March 2020\n\nThesis on Sports Data Analytics: Regression and tree based models\nFocus on Statistics, Probability and Finance\nMinor in Economics\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiances\n\nJunior Data Scientist\nCHECK24 | Technology Hub | June 2022 - Aug 2023\nAs a Data Scientist in the central Data Science team TechHub, I was at the forefront of driving customer success by delivering innovative ML solutions for various products within the company.\n\nResponsibility for the design, implementation and maintainance of end-to-end Learning-to-rank applications which serve thousands of customers on a daily basis to effortlessly find the products fitting their needs, constantly iterating and innovating to deliver the best possible experience and as a result improving conversion.\nCollaboration with stakeholders in cross-functional teams across multiple products required me to be highly flexible and a quick learner, with strong business acumen and strong communication skills.\nEquipment of stakeholders with rich dashboards in order to not only monitor but also to foster the explainability and transparency of the ML services.\nImproved the decision making process with cutting-edge statistical methodology in the realm of sequential A/B testing.\n\n\n\nData Scientist Intern\nKPMG | Financial Services Core/ Risk Banking | Sep 2019 - Dez 2019\nData Scientist role on a long-term project at an investment bank.\nPlanning and implementation of a custom automated data quality testing application for credit risk data in R, Rmarkdown and SQL. The generation of the reports was automated and the whole data quality testing cycle was reduced from 3 weeks (manually) to 4 hours (including review). The designed tests included univariate and multivariate outlier detection as well as other statistical methods.\n\n\nTeaching Assistant\nTUM School of Management | April 2019 - Aug 2019\nTutor for the lecture Statistics for Business Administration.\n\n\nIntern (Schnupperlehre)\nMunich RE | EU/LA Property | Juli 2013 - Aug 2013\nGot a first taste of the reinsurance business and of the company.\n\n\n\n\nTech Stack\nBelow you can find a selection of my most valued tools from my tech stack roughly grouped by topic. Most tools are open source packages from my two main programming languages R & Python. My command of both of them, especially R, is advanced.\n\nData Management\n\nSQL\nAWS S3 & Athena\n\nData Exploration & Wrangling\n\nPython: pandas, numpy, dbt\nR: tidyverse\n\nMachine Learning & Statistical Modeling\n\nDeep Learning: pytorch, tensorflow, torch\nStatistical Modeling: tidymodels, sklearn, lightgbm\nNLP: tidytext, nltk, fasttext\n\nMLOps\n\nMetaflow\nMLFlow\n\nModel Deployment\n\nAPIs: FastAPI, plumber\nAWS ECS, Copilot, CloudWatch\n\nDashboarding & Visualization\n\nR: shiny, golem\nPython: streamlit\nViz: ggplot2, plotly, matplotlib\n\nPackage & Software Development\n\nVersion Control & Collaboration: Git\nR package development: devtools, testthat\nDocker (compose)\nUtils: pre-commit\n\nOthers\n\nLaTeX\nMS Office"

    "text": "I‚Äôm Emanuel, a Mathematician & Data Scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics. Here, on this personal website I share insights on my journey of what I call my hikes on the paths of curiosity. The title not only resonates with my passion for hiking but also mirrors well how I tackle most things in life. This can be attributed to two key reasons.\n\nHiking is a naturally curious activity as I thrive to explore unseen territories, to challenge myself as well as to get better and grow with every step along the way.\nMuch like my pursuits, hiking demands endurance, good planning, and adaptability in the face of changing circumstances, just like sudden weather changes.\n\nAs you delve into this website, you‚Äôll mostly find my personal paths whose topics are related to Math, Stats, Tech, and my Professional Journey. Here‚Äôs a preview of what you can explore on this website:\n\nAbout: Want to know some more about me? This section is a good starting point and also covers my education, professional work experiences and tech stack.\nPublications: As the name suggests this section covers papers, software and other noteworthy publications.\nThoughts & Endeavors: A kind of mini blog ‚Äì think hobby projects, hackathons, resources and possibly even a sprinkle of non data science related stories. :)"
