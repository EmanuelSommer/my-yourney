Ever wondered how Netflix knows what youâ€™ll binge next or how Spotify curates the perfect playlist? In a workshop (held twice already) organized by the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML), I introduced high school students to the magic behind recommender systems!

With no prior knowledge required, participants explored the fundamentals of ML and built their own fashion recommender using an interactive Streamlit app. The hands-on session made abstract concepts tangibleâ€”because nothing beats learning by doing!

ðŸš€ Want to try it yourself? The GitHub repo with the resources for the interactive part, including the app and code, is publicly available: [Recommender Workshop Repo](https://github.com/EmanuelSommer/recommender_workshop).

If you're interested in running a similar session, feel free to use the materials (with proper credit) or reach out for slides and additional content. Always happy to chat! ðŸ˜Š
