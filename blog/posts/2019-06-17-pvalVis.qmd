The idea for this small project was born when many of the students of the course *Statistics of Business Administration*, where I was a tutor, had problems understanding the concept of P-values. Thus I created an {{< fa brands r-project >}} package that visualizes the P-values in the common setting of hypothesis tests for the 4 most common distributions. The usage, as it is meant for beginners in the field of statistics, is very straight forward.

Main {{< fa brands r-project >}} packages used: {ggplot2}, {devtools}
